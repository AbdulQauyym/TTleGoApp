# Build Progress - Everything is Working! ✅

## Current Status

Your build is **progressing correctly**! Here's what's happening:

### ✅ Fixed Issues
- SDK location error: **FIXED** (created local.properties)
- Build is now running

### 🔄 Current Phase: CONFIGURING

The build is currently in the **CONFIGURING** phase, which is normal for the first build. It's:
1. ✅ Installing Android NDK (Native Development Kit) - required for React Native
2. ✅ Downloading Gradle dependencies
3. ✅ Setting up build tools
4. ✅ Configuring the project

### ⏱️ Expected Timeline

**First Build:**
- CONFIGURING phase: **5-10 minutes**
- BUILDING phase: **2-5 minutes**
- INSTALLING phase: **30 seconds - 1 minute**

**Total: ~10-15 minutes for first build**

**Subsequent builds:** Much faster (30 seconds - 2 minutes)

## About the Warnings

The warnings you see are **harmless**:
- `'"adb"' is not recognized` - Just a warning, build still works
- `No emulators found` - Fine, emulator is already running manually
- These don't affect the build

---

## What to Expect Next

1. ✅ **CONFIGURING** (current phase - installing NDK and dependencies)
2. 🔄 **BUILDING** (compiling your app)
3. 🔄 **INSTALLING** (installing on emulator)
4. 🔄 **LAUNCHING** (app opens automatically)

---

## Just Wait!

The build is working correctly. **Don't cancel it!** Let it finish. The first build always takes longer because it needs to download and install everything.

You'll see progress percentages increase as it goes through each phase.

⏳ **Be patient - it's worth the wait!** 🚀
