# After NDK Installation - Next Steps

## Verify Installation

Once Android Studio shows the NDK installation is **100% complete**, we'll verify it's properly installed by checking for the `source.properties` file.

## Then Try Building Again

After NDK is properly installed, run:

```powershell
npm run android
```

The build should now work! 

## What to Expect

1. ✅ NDK properly installed (with source.properties file)
2. ✅ Build will progress through CONFIGURING phase
3. ✅ Build will compile your app
4. ✅ App will install on emulator
5. ✅ App will launch automatically

## If Installation Still Fails

If you still get errors after proper installation:
- Make sure you waited for 100% completion
- Try restarting Android Studio
- Check that the NDK directory has many files (not just 1-2)
- Verify source.properties exists in: `C:\Users\Zia\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk\27.1.12297006\source.properties`

Let me know when installation is complete! 🚀
