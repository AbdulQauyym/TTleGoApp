# Quick Start - Run Your App Now! 🚀

## Current Status
✅ **Emulator is running** (Google Pixel 5 - emulator-5554)
✅ **Metro bundler is running** (port 8081)
✅ **All dependencies installed**

## Run Your App - One Command!

Open a terminal in your project folder and run:

```powershell
npm run android
```

That's it! React Native will:
1. Build your app (creates APK automatically)
2. Install it on your emulator
3. Launch the app
4. Connect to Metro for hot reloading

**No need to manually create or install APK - React Native does everything!**

---

## What You'll See

1. Gradle build process (first time takes a few minutes)
2. App installing on emulator
3. App launching automatically
4. Your React Native app running!

---

## Tips

- **First build takes 2-5 minutes** (downloading Gradle dependencies)
- **Keep Metro bundler running** (the terminal with `npm start`)
- **Press `R` twice** in Metro terminal to reload
- **Edit code and save** - changes appear automatically!

Ready? Run: `npm run android` 🚀
