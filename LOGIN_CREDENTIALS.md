# Login Credentials

## Default Login Credentials

Based on the code in `src/components/Loginpage.js`, the app uses hardcoded credentials for demo purposes:

**Username:** `Admin`  
**Password:** `1234`

## How to Login

1. Open the app on your emulator/device
2. You'll see the login screen
3. Enter:
   - **Username:** `Admin`
   - **Password:** `1234`
4. Click the Login button
5. You'll be navigated to the MainTabs (main app interface)

## Note

These are hardcoded credentials for development/demo purposes. In a production app, you would typically:
- Connect to a backend API for authentication
- Store credentials securely
- Implement proper password hashing
- Use JWT tokens or session management

For now, these credentials are fine for testing the app locally!
